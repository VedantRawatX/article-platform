It uses modern JavaScript, is built with TypeScript (which helps in maintaining a robust codebase), and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).\n\nThis guide will walk you through the initial setup, core concepts like modules, controllers, and services, and how to build your first NestJS application. We'll cover topics such as routing, middleware, and basic data persistence. By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of why NestJS is a popular choice for backend development. We will also touch upon dependency injection, a key feature of NestJS that promotes modularity and testability.`,
